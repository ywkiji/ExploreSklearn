# Classification and regression models in Scikit-learn

I wanted to explore Scikit-learn a little, so I build a small library that allows me to try multiple classification models and regression models at once.

*** Update ***

I wrote up this page when I first started learning Python.
I have since learned of a library called autoML that is much better than my scrappy code.
That being said, I still think it was a great learning experience!
